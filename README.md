# school-2d-drawing-webgl

A webgl program which allows shapes to be drawn and colored in the browser. This readme is marked TODO.

## Instructions

You should be able to just clone the repo and open the html file in your browser to see it in action. I have not tested it in any browser other than Chrome, so it is possible that it doesn't work in all cases.

## Controls

* Left-Click: Place a vertex on the canvas. When enough vertices have been placed to compose a selected shape type, the shape will be drawn - e.g., if you select *triangle*, three vertices must be placed before it's drawn.

* Right-Click: Select a shape on the canvas. Once the shape is selected, you can change its color (and the color of all same-type shapes) by moving the color sliders listed below the shape types.
